# Literature Review: Parallel SAT Solving Methods for 3-CNF Satisfiability

## Abstract

This literature review examines the current state of parallel SAT solving methods, with a focus on 3-CNF satisfiability problems. We analyze various parallel approaches, their theoretical foundations, implementation strategies, and performance characteristics. This review serves as the foundation for Step 3 of our comprehensive 3-CNF SAT analysis project.

## 1. Introduction

The Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) is a fundamental NP-complete problem with significant theoretical and practical importance. As problem instances become larger and more complex, sequential SAT solvers face computational limitations. Parallel SAT solving has emerged as a critical approach to address these challenges, leveraging multiple processing units to improve performance and handle larger problem instances.

## 2. Parallel SAT Solving Paradigms

### 2.1 Search Space Partitioning

**Principle**: Divide the search space among multiple processors, with each processor exploring a disjoint subset of possible variable assignments.

**Key Studies**:

- Böhm and Speckenmeyer (1996): Early work on parallelizing the Davis-Putnam algorithm
- Zhang et al. (2002): Systematic search space partitioning for modern DPLL algorithms

**Advantages**:

- Good load balancing for certain problem classes
- Minimal communication overhead
- Scalable with available processors

**Disadvantages**:

- Potential for uneven work distribution
- May explore unnecessary parts of search space
- Limited by sequential bottlenecks in problem decomposition

### 2.2 Portfolio Approaches

**Principle**: Run different solvers or solver configurations simultaneously, terminating when any solver finds a solution.

**Key Studies**:

- Huberman et al. (1997): Early portfolio methods for constraint satisfaction
- Hamadi et al. (2009): Comprehensive analysis of parallel portfolio SAT solving

**Advantages**:

- Leverages complementary strengths of different algorithms
- Robust performance across diverse problem instances
- Simple to implement and deploy

**Disadvantages**:

- Resource redundancy when multiple solvers work on same problem
- Limited theoretical speedup guarantees
- Requires careful selection of portfolio components

### 2.3 Clause Sharing and Learning

**Principle**: Share learned clauses between parallel solver instances to prune search spaces more effectively.

**Key Studies**:

- Blochinger et al. (2003): Distributed learning in parallel SAT solving
- Hamadi and Wintersteiger (2013): Modern clause sharing strategies

**Advantages**:

- Exponential potential for search space reduction
- Synergistic effects between parallel instances
- Maintains completeness guarantees

**Disadvantages**:

- Communication overhead for clause sharing
- Memory management challenges
- Quality control for shared clauses

### 2.4 Divide-and-Conquer Approaches

**Principle**: Recursively decompose the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved independently.

**Key Studies**:

- Schubert et al. (2009): Cube-and-conquer approach
- Heule et al. (2011): Look-ahead based problem decomposition

**Advantages**:

- Natural parallelization structure
- Good theoretical foundations
- Effective for certain problem classes

**Disadvantages**:

- Decomposition overhead
- Potential for poor load balancing
- May not suit all problem types

## 4. Performance Analysis and Metrics

### 4.1 Speedup Metrics

**Linear Speedup**: S(p) = p (ideal case)
**Actual Speedup**: Often sublinear due to:

- Communication overhead
- Load imbalancing
- Sequential components (Amdahl's Law)

### 4.2 Efficiency Metrics

**Parallel Efficiency**: E(p) = S(p)/p

- Values close to 1.0 indicate good parallelization
- Typically decreases with increasing processor count

### 4.3 Scalability Analysis

**Strong Scaling**: Fixed problem size, increasing processors
**Weak Scaling**: Problem size increases proportionally with processors

## 5. Theoretical Foundations

### 5.1 Complexity Analysis

**Parallel Complexity Classes**:

- NC (Nick's Class): Problems solvable in polylogarithmic time with polynomial processors
- P-complete: Problems unlikely to have efficient parallel solutions

**SAT Parallel Complexity**:
