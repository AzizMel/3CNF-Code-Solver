This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of sequential and parallel approaches to solving 3-CNF satisfiability problems. We implement and evaluate three sequential algorithms (Brute Force, DPLL, and WalkSAT) and develop a novel MPI-based parallel framework incorporating multiple strategies including search space partitioning, portfolio approaches, and work stealing. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements with parallel approaches, achieving speedups of up to 22.74× on 4 cores compared to sequential implementations. The paper provides both theoretical analysis and practical insights for parallel SAT solving, contributing to the understanding of scalable approaches for NP-complete problems."""
